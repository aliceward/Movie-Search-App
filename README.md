# Movie-Search-App
Lab 4 for CSE 438: Mobile App Development

This app allows the user to search The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/) for information about any movie. It uses a remote API to parse JSON data into the app so the user may see the movie's title, poster, release date, popularity score, and a brief description. The user may also add movies to their favorites or to their watchlist.
